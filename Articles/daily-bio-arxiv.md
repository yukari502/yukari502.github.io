# Daily-Bio-Arxiv: Automating Scientific Discovery with AI

This project, **Daily-Bio-Arxiv**, is a sophisticated tool designed to streamline the process of staying updated with the latest scientific research. It automatically crawls the arXiv repository daily, focusing on specific categories such as biology and computer science. Leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), it generates concise summaries of new papers in a language of your choice. These summaries are then automatically published to a clean, accessible GitHub Pages website, making cutting-edge research easily digestible.

## Key Features:

*   **Daily Updates**: Automatically fetches new papers from arXiv.
*   **AI-Powered Summaries**: Utilizes LLMs for efficient and accurate summarization.
*   **Customizable**: Configure categories, LLM, and summary language.
*   **Automated Deployment**: Publishes summaries to a GitHub Pages website.

## Getting Started:

To set up this project, you'll need to fork the repository, configure necessary secrets (like API keys for LLMs) and variables (such as arXiv categories and desired summary language) in your GitHub repository settings, and then run the provided GitHub Action.

## Technologies Used:

*   **Programming Language**: Python
*   **Web Technologies**: HTML, CSS
*   **Automation**: GitHub Actions, Shell scripting
*   **AI**: LLMs for summarization

This project is a testament to how AI can be integrated into scientific workflows to enhance accessibility and understanding of complex research.
