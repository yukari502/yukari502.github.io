# About Me

Hello there! I'm thrilled to introduce myself and share a new project I've been passionately working on. I've recently launched a GitHub repository designed to streamline access to the latest research from BioRxiv.

This innovative tool automatically crawls BioRxiv daily, leveraging AI to summarize new preprints. A JavaScript script then meticulously packages these summaries into a clean Markdown format, making them readily available for display on a dedicated webpage. My goal is to make staying updated with cutting-edge biological research as effortless and efficient as possible. Feel free to explore the repository and join me in this exciting endeavor!
